Create a variable named pi and store the value 22/7 in it.
Now check the data type of this variable.
'''

pi = 22 / 7
print(pi)
print(type(pi))

'''
Store the principal amount, rate of interest, and time in
different variables and then calculate the Simple Interest for 3
years. Formula: Simple Interest = P x R x T / 100
'''

principalAmount = 1000
rateOfInterest = 5
time = 3

simpleInterest = (principalAmount * rateOfInterest * time) / 100

print("Simple Interest is", simpleInterest)
